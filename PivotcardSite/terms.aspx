            <li><strong>&nbsp; </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not for Resale Software.</strong> If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not
                        for Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, you may
                        not resell, or otherwise transfer for value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. </li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly.</strong>

                        the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding
                        this limitation. Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a
                        single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one

                        related to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is
                        governed by the Pivotcard polices and programs described in the user manual, in
                        "online" documentation, and/or in other Pivotcard-provided materials. Any supplemental
                        software code provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered
                        part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.
                        With respect to technical information you provide to Pivotcard as part of the Support
                        Services, Pivotcard may use such information for its business purposes, including
                        for product support and development. Pivotcard will not utilize such technical information
                        in a form that personally identifies you. </li>
                    <li><strong>Software Transfer.</strong> You may permanently transfer all of your rights
                        under this EULA, provided you retain no copies, you transfer all of the SOFTWARE
                        PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades,
                        this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity), and the recipient
                        agrees to the terms of this EULA. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade, any transfer
                        must include all prior versions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. </li>
                    <li><strong>Termination.</strong> Without prejudice to any other rights, Pivotcard may
                        terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
                        EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all
                        of its component parts.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <strong>&nbsp; </strong></li>
            <li><strong>UPGRADES. </strong>If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled as an upgrade, you
                must be properly licensed to use a product identified by Pivotcard as being eligible
                for the upgrade in order to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. A SOFTWARE PRODUCT labeled
                as an upgrade replaces and/or supplements the product that formed the basis for
                your eligibility for the upgrade. You may use the resulting upgraded product only
                in accordance with the terms of this EULA. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is an upgrade
                of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product,
                the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be used and transferred only as part of that single product
                package and may not be separated for use on more than one computer.<br />

                (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
                music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying
                printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by Pivotcard
                or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international
                treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE PRODUCT like any other
                copyrighted material except that you may install the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a single
                computer provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.
                You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.<br />
                &nbsp; </li>
            <li><strong>DUAL-MEDIA SOFTWARE .</strong> You may receive the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in more
                than one medium. Regardless of the type or size of medium you receive, you may use
                only one medium that is appropriate for your single computer. You may not use or
                install the other medium on another computer. You may not loan, rent, lease, or
                otherwise transfer the other medium to another user, except as part of the permanent
                transfer (as provided above) of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.<br />

                (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19,

            <strong>MISCELLANEOUS </strong>If you acquired this product in the United States,
            this EULA is governed by the laws of the State of Washington. If this product was
            acquired outside the United States, then local law may apply. Should you have any
            questions concerning this EULA, or if you desire to contact Pivotcard for any reason,
            please contact the Pivotcard subsidiary serving your country, or write: Pivotcard
            LIMITED WARRANTY<strong> LIMITED WARRANTY.</strong> Pivotcard warrants that (a)
            the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying
            written materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt, and

            Some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied
            warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you. To the extent allowed by
            applicable law, implied warranties on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, if any, are limited
            to ninety (90) days. CUSTOMER REMEDIES. Pivotcard's and its suppliers' entire liability
            and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Pivotcard's option, either (a) return of
            the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that
            does not meet Pivotcard's Limited Warranty and which is returned to Pivotcard with
            a copy of your receipt. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE
            PRODUCT has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE
            PRODUCT will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty
            (30) days, whichever is longer. Outside the United States, neither these remedies
            nor any product support services offered by Pivotcard are available without proof
            of purchase from an authorized international source.</p>

            TO STATE/JURISDICTION. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED
            BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL Pivotcard OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF
            BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
            INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE

            DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, Pivotcard'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA
            SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE
